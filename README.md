# Friction
A browser extension to add a bit of friction to bad browsing habits.

If you often find yourself unthinkingly checking the same sites over and over
and seem to waste a lot of time there, this browser extension may help a bit.

Blacklist sites that you want to discourage for yourself, and the extension
will "lock" those sites for you. However, the point is not to shut you off
entirely, but just to discourage it a bit by adding a small (configurable)
delay before you can unlock the sites. Once unlocked, the sites will be
available for a (configurable) time, after which you will have to unlock them
again.
